How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area allows you to have more flexibility than you normally would without the staging area. It allows you to make more changes before committing to the live area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	To test the status of any changes made. You can also use gif diff to check the difference between the last commit and what is in the staging area.
